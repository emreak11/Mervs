**Core Question and Conceptual Motivation**

Biological oscillators such as the segmentation clock are most commonly studied through genetic regulation and molecular signaling pathways. In the context of the Notch–Delta system, changes in oscillatory behavior are usually attributed to variations in gene expression levels, signaling strength, or biochemical feedback loops. However, developing tissues are not purely biochemical systems; they are also physical systems composed of cells with specific shapes, sizes, and spatial organizations.

This project is motivated by the idea that tissue geometry itself may play an active role in shaping collective dynamics.

The central question of this work is:

Is it possible for changes in cell geometry and cell–cell contact topology alone—while the Notch–Delta pathway and gene regulatory circuit remain unchanged—to shift tissue-scale dynamics such as phase synchronization and phase gradients in the segmentation clock by modifying neighbor cell coupling?

Rather than asking how genetic components change oscillatory behavior, this project asks whether cell morphology can act as a non-genetic control parameter for collective oscillations.


**Central Hypothesis**

The core hypothesis of this project is that cell geometry and contact topology influence the effective coupling between neighboring cells, and that these geometric effects are sufficient to alter tissue-scale oscillatory dynamics.

More specifically, the hypothesis proposes that:
•	Cell shape, size, and packing geometry determine how cells interact with their neighbors.
•	These geometric properties modulate effective parameters such as coupling strength and signaling delay in juxtacrine Notch–Delta interactions.
• Changes in these effective parameters can shift collective behaviors including:
    • phase synchronization,
    • phase gradient,
    • and wave-like propagation of oscillatory signals.
Importantly, this hypothesis does not rely on changes in gene expression, molecular kinetics, or pathway architecture. Geometry is treated as a non-genetic regulatory factor capable of influencing tissue-level dynamics.


**Scientific Motivation and Novelty**

Segmentation clock oscillations are conserved across species, yet measurable differences exist in oscillation period, phase gradients, and spatiotemporal wave patterns among organisms such as zebrafish, chick, mouse, and human embryos. These differences are typically explained through genetic or biochemical variation.

This project explores an alternative and complementary explanation:

A portion of the observed differences in segmentation clock dynamics across tissues or species may arise from differences in cell morphology and tissue organization rather than genetic changes alone.

If supported, this idea suggests that:
• developmental dynamics are partially controlled by physical tissue architecture,
• conserved genetic circuits can generate different outcomes under different geometric constraints,
• morphology contributes to both robustness and variability in pattern formation.
While physical aspects of development are increasingly recognized as important, their direct role in oscillatory signaling systems remains underexplored, making this question both timely and relevant.

**Conceptual Approach**

This project adopts an abstraction-driven and constraint-based approach. Instead of modeling detailed molecular mechanisms of Notch signaling, the genetic circuit is treated as fixed, and attention is focused on how geometric properties reshape effective interaction parameters between cells.

Cell geometry and contact topology are represented through simplified, measurable quantities that influence:
• effective coupling strength between neighboring cells,
• effective signaling delays arising from spatial organization.

The goal is not to reproduce every biochemical step, but to identify which tissue-scale dynamical regimes—such as synchronization, phase gradients, or loss of coherence—are enabled or suppressed under different geometric constraints.


**Scope and Intent**

This work is intended as a conceptual and computational investigation. It does not claim to provide definitive biological causality, but rather to:
• formulate a clear and testable hypothesis,
• identify geometric features most likely to influence collective dynamics,
• provide a framework that can guide future experimental or theoretical studies.

By clearly documenting the question, assumptions, and constraints, this project aims to serve both as a scientific contribution and as a transparent record of the reasoning process behind the model.
